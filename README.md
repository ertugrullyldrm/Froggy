# Froggy: A 2D Block Assembling Game

This project is a clone of a simple and addictive 2D block merging game, similar to the popular mobile game ‘2048’ or ‘1024’. The game aims to combine blocks with the same values by sliding them up, down, right or left. The merges double the value of the block. The goal of the game is to reach a block with the highest value by merging blocks.
